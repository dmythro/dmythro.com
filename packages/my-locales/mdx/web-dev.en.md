_TL;DR_

Today I mainly work with **TypeScript based full-stack projects** (Node.js, React, React Native), **cloud platforms** (Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, AWS, Vercel, Supabase etc) as **Tech&nbsp;Lead** / **Principal** / **Senior&nbsp;Engineer**.

Also, work on some **open-source** projects. Like [current website](https://github.com/dmythro/dmythro.com) or my `countries-list` module with [~1k stars on GitHub](https://github.com/annexare/Countries) and [600k+/mo downloads on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/countries-list).

The **FAQ** section contains a bit more details on the current situation.
