Traveling is a big part of my life and I hope it always will be. It's always something new &mdash; architecture, history, museums, culture.

Visited almost every country in Europe. And not just a quick fly over and see couple tourist attractions. I really enjoy car trips and try to see this way much more. My biggest car trip so far was around 10k km, 10 counntries over 6 weeks, from Ukraine to Atlantic Ocean and back.

Also seen a bit of USA, Dubai and more.

Been traveling a lot over Ukraine as well, it is very rich on beautiful places (mountains, lakes, rivers and of course cities).

I enjoy watching sunsets, clouds, starry skies. When combined with mountains, lakes, forests &mdash; even better :)
