## What kind of a role are you looking for?

In general, I'm looking for something like a tech lead role, where about 50-70% of the working time is actual development and the rest is for meetings/planning/mentoring/code reviews etc. I really enjoy doing something myself, and I prefer working on some complex tasks without much of a distraction.

## Are you in Ukraine now? Is it safe?

Yes. I'm here in my house most of the time. I'd say it is relatively safe here now. My location turned out to be pretty good in this situation counting I'm pretty close to Kyiv (southern direction).

## How do you deal with obvious risks?

I have big batteries that can supply core electronics (heating, lights, optical internet connection) for a couple of days during winter. I can charge batteries with my generators, switch to batteries and back is automatic and seamless. I have reinforced film on my windows to avoid shattering (just in case). Also, I have a safer place below the ground floor. I have a car with a full tank of gas and extra gas just in case. The main risk is a direct hit, which I hope won't happen.

## Do you plan to leave Ukraine?

No, I don't have plans like that now. I chose to stay in Ukraine and support family, people and the army where I can. Surely I have doubts sometimes, so monitoring the situation from a safety point of view.

## Do you have open-source projects?

Sure, I love open source community and contribute where I can. My biggest NPM module `countries-list` has 800k+ downloads/month. You can check them, or the source code of the current website on GitHub.

## Do you prefer remote work, office or hybrid?

In recent years, I have primarily worked remotely. In general, I truly value real-life communication and am happy to have periodical in-person meetings. But not on a day-to-day basis right now, not until the end of the war. I try to be highly available during a working day, so video calls are possible whenever it is required.
