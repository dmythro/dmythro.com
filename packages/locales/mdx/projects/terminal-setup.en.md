The **`terminal-setup`** project bootstraps a productive **macOS Terminal.app** environment with a single command. It installs and configures a modern shell setup — **fish-like autosuggestions**, **syntax highlighting**, **fzf** fuzzy finder, and a **[Starship](https://starship.rs/)** prompt — so you get a polished terminal experience without hours of manual dotfile tweaking.

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmythro/terminal-setup/main/install.sh)"
```

The install script is **idempotent**: running it again updates everything without duplicating configuration. It sets up a **50,000-line shell history** with smart search, configures **tmux** for session management, and applies a carefully tuned color scheme and font setup for Terminal.app.

Beyond the shell basics, the setup optionally installs development tools — **Bun**, **Node.js** via **fnm**, and common CLI utilities. Each optional component can be skipped, so you can use it as a full dev machine bootstrap or just grab the shell configuration.

The project is designed for fresh **macOS** installs and pairs well with dotfile backup workflows. Everything is version-controlled and documented, making it easy to reproduce the same environment across multiple machines.
