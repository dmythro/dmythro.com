**`agent-skills`** is a collection of reusable skills for **AI coding assistants** like **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, and other agents compatible with the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) platform.

Each skill is a focused knowledge module that gives an AI agent expertise in a specific area. The collection currently includes five skills:

- **bun-cli** — Bun CLI reference: package management, scripts, testing, bundling, and compilation
- **bun-api** — Bun runtime API: file I/O, shell, SQLite, SQL client (PostgreSQL/MySQL), hashing, compression
- **git-commit** — Conventional Commits format for git commits and PR/MR titles
- **git-pr** — PR and MR workflows for GitHub (`gh`) and GitLab (`glab`): creation, review, comments, merging
- **git-ci** — CI/CD status queries for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI

```sh
# Install a single skill
bunx skills add dmythro/agent-skills --skill bun-cli

# Install all skills at once
bunx skills add dmythro/agent-skills
```

Skills are installed per-project or globally and are automatically activated when the agent detects a matching context — for example, the **bun-cli** skill activates when working in a project with `bun.lock` or `bunfig.toml`.
