Music and traveling are obviously my biggest hobbies. But also I enjoy a lot of things in this constantly developing world. Apparently, I am a very curious person.

#### Technology & New Gear

This is something I really like to get into and try for areas I'm involved. New gear for music (instruments, effects, pedals, audio interfaces & monitors, amplifiers etc). Smart home devices to make my life easier with automations and sensors. Electric scooters, bicycles etc.

#### Active Lifestyle

I really enjoy snowboarding, surfing, kayaks, cycling. Some of that happens not really often, but when I feel I miss it I'll definitely go for it. Driving on sands in the desert, huge aqua parks, rollercoasters, parachute jump &mdash; I did it all as well.

#### Art Books

Reading is not my strongest side. I like some science fiction like Roger Zelazny, Dan Brown etc but not reading that much. On the other hand, I really like art books and collect some of those. About music, art, history, architecture, museums and more.
