Music always was and is now a big part of my life.

Thanks to my father, I was introduced to music since early childhood. Started collecting Pink Floyd since I was about 6 y.o. and still a big fan. Volunterily signed to the music school when I was 7, which I graduated with honors.

As a teenager started listening to different metal and electronic music subgenres, that's where my fascination about music and playing different instruments got into the next level. Now I play guitars, drums, keyboards and some folk instruments. Have a home recording studio. Always curious about sound design and quality, instruments, equipment, effects etc.

Since 2011 running indie record label and a music zine &mdash; [Noizr](https://noizr.com). It still is a non-profit project, all income is re-invested into our artist development (since russian invasion all accumulated income for last couple years is donated to Ukrainian army and Come Back Alive fund).

P.S. You can watch me playing live with Nabaath [here](https://youtu.be/ThlDSKGNc-k) or [here](https://youtu.be/osGApVlgYk8) (warning: it may be a bit "too heavy" for some).
