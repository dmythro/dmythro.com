_TL;DR_\
Today I mainly work with **TypeScript based full-stack projects** (Node.js, React, React Native), **cloud platforms** (Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, AWS etc).

Technology was my passion since childhood and cartoons like "Transformers". And it still is my passion today, one of the main points of interest.

I started learning programming in school with Pascal and Basic. Mainly to solve some puzzles like route a horse on a chess board to hit each point but only once.
