_TL;DR_\
Today I mainly work with **TypeScript based full-stack projects** (Node.js, React, React Native), **cloud platforms** (Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, AWS etc).

Technology was my passion since childhood and cartoons like "Transformers". And it still is my passion today, one of the main points of interest.

I started learning programming in school with Pascal and Basic. Mainly to solve some puzzles like route a horse on a chess board to hit each point but only once (was one of the first, still remember).

Some of those are still online, but the stack is pretty outdated.

The game combined isometric city-builder and online match-making based on the team stats and some amount of a random factor. With quests, achievements, in-game purchases and more. It was a pretty complex project. But since Flash became deprecated we didn't put effort to rework it for the modern web and it was closed.
